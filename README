### CS3511 Project: Federated Learning Simulation for MNIST ClassiÔ¨Åcation
 To run the simulation, run the following command:
```
python s1s2.py --mode 1 -r 10 -e 10 --lr 0.02 # Stage 1
python s1s2.py --mode 2 -r 10 -e 10 --lr 0.02 -M 5 # Stage 2
python s3.py -c 5 -r 5 -e 5 --lr 0.02 # Stage 3
```
'mode' is the stage of the simulation. 
'r' is the number of rounds.
'e' is the number of epochs. 
'lr' is the learning rate. 
'M' is the number of clients per round in Stage 2.
'c' is the number of clients in Stage 3. 
The simulation results will be saved in the 'output' folder.

You can also directly run the bash script to run the simulation:
```
bash example_scripts.sh
```
